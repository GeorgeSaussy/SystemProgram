README

In this directory is a sub-directory "libsvm-master". This directory is a copy
of the LIBSVM suite by Chih-Chung Chang and Chih-Jen Lin. (Some documentation
for the software can be found at csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/ and the GitHub
repo for the software can be found at github.com/cjlin1/libsvm .) To run the
SVM, cd into the svm directory. There, run first
    $ python svm_data_writer.py
Then run
    $ libsvm-master/svm-train -s 0 -t 1 -d 2 all_svm_data all_svm_data_model
and finally
    $  libsvm-master/svm-predict sysprogram_svm_data all_svm_data_model sysprogram_svm_prediction
The file "sysprogram_svm_prediction" now contains the output of the SVM's
prediction. 1 corresponds to Hegel, 2 to Hölderlin, and  o Schelling.
To replicate the testing of the SVM model, call
    $ libsvm-master/svm-train -s 0 -t 1 -d 2 training_svm_data training_svm_data_model
and then
    $ libsvm-master/svm-predict testing_svm_data training_svm_data_model testing_svm_prediction
If everything went well, you should get an accuracy of 55.2083%. Reviewing
testing_svm_prediction should reveal every datum was classified as 2, or as by
Hölderlin. This indicated the data was not seperable. The failure of this model
is discussed in the writeup.
"svm_data_writer.py" is self-documented as well. For further documentation on
LIBSVM, "svm/libsvm-master/README" has an outline. In addition, calling any of
the LIBSVM binaries without options will print help.

There are additional files in this directory. Their contents and function are
documented here.

    *corpus2
    These files contain the scraped texts by each author concatenated with each
text separated by a line "#newtext". This is read into svm_dat_writer.py to
build the confusion matrix.

    functional_words_de
The file contains German functional words. Some lines containing verbs,
contain each of the conjugations for each person in a given tense. The nouns',
articles', and pronouns' lines contain each declension. The selection of these
words is discussed in the writeup.

    systemprogram
The file contains the text of "The Earliest System Program of German
Idealism". This is the text of which the classifier is trying to find the
author.
