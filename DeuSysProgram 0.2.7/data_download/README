README

These files are only included here for completion. Their functionality cannot be
guaranteed, as integration with the web is time sensitive. They have been
untested since they were first run because their runtime can be a few hours.
However, we felt these files should be included in case error in the corpera
could be explained by some of the parsing here. To run the program, in this
directory run the command
    $ python download.py
