README

The Naive Bayes is run by, in the naivebayes directory, running first
	$ python naivebayes_logwriter.py -d func
and then
	$ python naivebayse_classifier.py
As an example "logfreq_data" contains the printed information from
naivebayes_logwriter.py. The model prints the log-likelihood that each author
wrote the text. It also prints the confusion matrix given the model only trained
on 90% of the data and tested on the other 10%. The model uses +1 smoothing. See
the "naivebayes_logwriter.py" and "naivebayes_classifier.py" self-documentation
for further details.
In addition, if instead of with the "func" option, one writes
    $ python naivebayes_logwriter.py -d all
the program will use the authors' combined vocabulary to run the Naive Bayes
model instead of the just the functional words. See the writeup for more notes
on the distinction. Binning changes the results and is discussed in the writeup.
Both "naivebayes_logwriter.py" and "naivebayes_classifier.py" are
self documented as well.


There are additional files in this directory. Their contents and function are
documented here.

    *corpus
    These files contain the scraped texts by each author concatenated. This is
read into naivebayes_logwriter.py to build the probability distribution (with +1
smoothing) for each author.

    *corpus2
    These files contain the scraped texts by each author concatenated with each
text separated by a line "#newtext". This is read into naivebayes_classifer.py
to build the confusion matrix.

    functional_words_de
    The file contains German functional words. Some lines containing verbs,
contain each of the conjugations for each person in a given tense. The nouns',
articles', and pronouns' lines contain each declension. The selection of these
words is discussed in the writeup.

    systemprogram
The file contains the text of "The Earliest System Program of German
Idealism". This is the text of which the classifier is trying to find the
author.
