README
The perceptron is run by, in the "perceptron" sub-directory using the command
    $ python perceptron.py --eta [float] --itrs [int]
Where the "eta" parameter is the learning factor for the model and the "itrs"
parameter is the number of iterations. The program will print the strength with
which a perceptron trained to recognize each author believes the System Program
was written by that author. It was found that the model was extremely sensitive
to the learning parameter. This is consistent with the results from the SVM and
indicate that the data in the training corpus is not separable. This is further
discussed in the writeup. See "perceptron/README" for further documentation and
"perceptron.py" is self-documented as well.


There are additional files in this directory. Their contents and function are
documented here.

    *corpus2
    These files contain the scraped texts by each author concatenated with each
text separated by a line "#newtext". This is read into naivebayes_classifer.py
to build the confusion matrix.

    functional_words_de
    The file contains German functional words. Some lines containing verbs,
contain each of the conjugations for each person in a given tense. The nouns',
articles', and pronouns' lines contain each declension. The selection of these
words is discussed in the writeup.

    systemprogram
    The file contains the text of "The Earliest System Program of German
Idealism". This is the text of which the classifier is trying to find the
author.
